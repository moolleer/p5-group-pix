## Testing


### Group Pix API

#### Manual Testing





#### PEP8

The Group Pix API has been passed through the internal PEP8 validation tests which I installed into GitPod. The method I used to do this was as per the Slack Article written by kevin_ci on the 28th September 2022 in #announcements:

1. Run the command 'pip3 install pycodestyle'. Note that this extension may already be installed.
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+P in your workspace (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
3. Type 'linter' into the search bar that appears.
4. Select 'Python: Select Linter
5. Select 'pycodestyle' from the list
6. PEP8 errors are now displayed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal and underlined in red.
